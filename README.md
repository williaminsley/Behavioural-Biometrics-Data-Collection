# Behavioural Typing & Tapping Game

Browser-based behavioural data collection game built for MSc dissertation research.

## Purpose
To collect high-level behavioural metrics (reaction time, accuracy, inter-key timing, tapping performance)
in a controlled, ethical, browser-based environment.

## Data Collected
- Session metadata (timestamp, device info)
- Contextual variables (time of day, fatigue, input device, vibration, alcohol)
- Typing metrics (accuracy, score, mean inter-key time, backspaces)
- Tapping metrics (hits, misses, reaction time)
- Aggregate session scores

No raw typed text or personally identifiable information is stored.

## Tech Stack
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (ES Modules)
- Client-side only (GitHub Pages compatible)

## Ethics
- Explicit user consent required before participation
- No keystroke content stored
